## Conclusion

The Enhanced Transformer model represents the current state-of-the-art in our research, achieving 39.58% β₁ accuracy through mathematical feature engineering and attention mechanisms. While exact factorization remains elusive, the consistent learning patterns across all models suggest that neural networks can capture meaningful mathematical structures relevant to RSA factorization.

The key insight is that **mathematical features matter more than architectural complexity** - the Enhanced Transformer's success comes primarily from its 125-dimensional mathematical input representation rather than the transformer architecture itself. This suggests that future research should focus on even richer mathematical feature engineering combined with hybrid classical-ML approaches.
